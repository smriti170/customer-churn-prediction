Certainly, here's a detailed description of the code you provided:

The code begins by importing the necessary libraries from Scikit-learn: train_test_split for splitting the data into training and testing sets, LogisticRegression for the machine learning model, and accuracy_score and f1_score for evaluating the model's performance.

Next, the customer data is loaded from a CSV file named 'customer_data.csv' and assigned to the 'data' variable.

The code then engineers two new features from the existing data:
1. 'usage_time': This feature represents the average time spent per session, calculated as the 'total_minutes' divided by the 'num_sessions'.
2. 'avg_ticket_value': This feature represents the average ticket value, calculated as the 'total_revenue' divided by the 'num_purchases'.

These new features are added to the 'data' DataFrame, providing additional information that may help the model better predict customer churn.

The data is then split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function. The feature columns ('usage_time', 'avg_ticket_value', and 'num_support_tickets') are assigned to the 'X' variable, and the target column ('churned') is assigned to the 'y' variable. The test size is set to 20%, and a random_state of 42 is used to ensure reproducibility of the split.

A Logistic Regression model is created using the LogisticRegression class from Scikit-learn, and the model is trained on the training data using the fit method.

Finally, the trained model is used to make predictions on the test data, and the accuracy and F1-score metrics are calculated using the accuracy_score and f1_score functions from Scikit-learn, respectively. The results are printed to the console.

The key steps in this code are:
1. Data loading
2. Feature engineering
3. Train-test split
4. Logistic Regression model training
5. Model evaluation using accuracy and F1-score

This code demonstrates a typical machine learning workflow for predicting customer churn using Logistic Regression. The engineered features, such as average usage time and average ticket value, can provide additional insights into customer behavior and potentially improve the model's performance in predicting which customers are likely to churn.
